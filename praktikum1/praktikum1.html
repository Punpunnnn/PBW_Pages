<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p><b>S</b>trawberries are sweet supple red fruits with surfaces that are seed-<br>
    studded. They come from a low-growing plant belonging to genus<br> 
    Fragaria of the rose (Rosaceae) family, enclosing white flowers, lobed<br> 
    foliage, and runners. They originate all through the north temperate zones.</p>
            
    <br><p>They are the most famous and trendiest fruits in the planet (Roger). There<br>  
    are over 600 assortments of strawberries that vary in taste, size, and feel;<br>  
    all of which have similar trait; heart silhouette, red fleshy tissue with yellow<br>  
    seeds shooting the surface, petite, royal, leafy green lids, and stalk that<br>  
    embellish their crowns (WHFoods). Below is picture of the strawberry fruit.

<h2 id="History">Detailed History</h2>
    <p>
    The word strawberry is coined from 'strewn" berries about the plants and<br>  
    thus the "strewn berry" finally turned into "Strawberry" (Roger). They are<br>  
    not actual fruits or berries but distended ends of the stamen of the plant.<br>  
    The seeds are on the external surface, rather than the internal berry. There<br>  
    are around 200 seeds for each berry. They are low in calories and are<br>  
    non-fat, loaded with vitamin c, folic acid, fiber, vitamin B6 and potassium (Roger).</p>

    <br><p>Over the years they have been utilized as medications for ailments like,<br>
    stained teeth, sunburns, gouts and digestion (Hopley, 9). Strawberries<br> 
    were served up at medieval state occasions as a show of peace, wealth,<br>
    and excellence. The most well-known communal intake of strawberries is<br> 
    at Wimbledon annually, when strawberries and cream are eaten by very<br> 
    well attired Englishmen in the middle of tennis games (Hopley, 9).</p>

<h2 id="Various">Various uses of strawberries</h2>
    <p>
    Strawberries have numerous uses. One of the most famous uses of<br> 
    strawberries is being used as recipe or an ingredient in preparation of<br> 
    drinks, meals or snacks. Strawberries are used as ingredients in many<br> 
    types of foods like cakes, yoghurts, desserts, salads, juices, meals and<br> 
    chocolates.<br>
